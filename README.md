vissense-demo
=================

[A playground for VisSense.js](https://vissense.github.io/vissense-demo/).

This project aims to provide a basic overview about what [VisSense.js](https://github.com/vissense/vissense) can actually do for you.

It is more or less a proof-of-concept type of poject - so the source is still a bit messy.
